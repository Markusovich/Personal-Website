        | This page is dedicated to my travels around the world. I share a few pictures of the scenery that caught my eye, as well as a brief description of it.

          | During my time in Frankfurt, I often took long walks in the city. Pictured right is the style of the buildings. Notice the difference in building design compared to the United States.

          | Summer in Colorado can be a very great time. During my time in Colorado, I took this picture of a rocky hill. The closer you get to the &apos;wild west&apos;, the more you see dry hills. This is because the climate is different than the east coasts&apos;.

          | During my time in Serbia, I went to the capital city Belgrade. One particular thing that I enjoyed was learning about the historic fortresses. The wall pictured right was built in 259 BC and is still standing.

        span
          | Just like the previous caption, this castle has been up for over 2,000 years. Pictured is my brother (L) and me (R).

          | Last but not least, what better vacation is there than a walk around the SIUC campus lake?
